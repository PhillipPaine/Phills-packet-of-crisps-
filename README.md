Hi Tom I've got around to setting up a Git Hub Account, I downloaded the desktop version along with the visual studio code text editor. 

I have been familiarising myself with navigating around the UI. As well as looking through the actions tab at the various workflow options they have. Eager to learn more about containerization. 

Was wondering if a random number generator would be a good first project?

Many Thanks, Phillip

Hi Phil!

Sounds like a great idea!
Have a look at https://github.com/GhostWriters/docker-packt-cli for some ideas of github workflows and gates to keep your code tidy.

This will create a PR so you can see the process!
