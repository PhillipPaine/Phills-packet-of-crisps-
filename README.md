Hi Tom I've got around to setting up a Git Hub Account, I downloaded the desktop version along with the visual studio code text editor. 

I have been familiarising myself with navigating around the UI. As well as looking through the actions tab at the various workflow options they have. Eager to learn more about containerization. 

Many Thanks Phillip
